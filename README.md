HODLpac is the single issue voter DAO. A FEC-registered and community-governed political action committee, HODLpac's mission is to build support for crypto-friendly public policy in the US Congress by supporting candidates for the House and Senate. We're also building the tools for crypto-native political organizations, including "Gitcoin Grants for political giving" and a "HODLscore" database to track where candidates and legislators stand on relevant issues to crypto. 

The goal of this project is to build a system for creating customizable NFTs to reward HODLpac donors. 

Here is the inspiration for our "membership card" NFTs - https://twitter.com/katdov/status/1449862008115843074 

There will be different cards for different donation levels.
